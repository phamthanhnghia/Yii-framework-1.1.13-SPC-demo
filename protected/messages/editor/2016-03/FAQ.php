                              <p class='faq_answer'>A. Even if you are in a desperate situation, borrowing money from any person in a business relation with the company is prohibited. You may think this case does not go against the principle of trust and faith, but your acquaintance may feel obliged to accede to your request because of the business relation between you and her/him. </p>

The fact that your uncle is working for one of our partner companies should not matter if all the business practices are done in accordance with given conditions and regulations, and productivity may be rather increased because you have a good and close relationship.</p>
                                <p class='faq_answer'>In your case, it is recommended that you first report to your manager or relevant department the fact that your uncle is working for one of our partners and he is in charge of business you are involved in. This is a report regarding conflict of interests. The leader or department will accept and review your report and then take the appropriate actions.</p>

                                <p class='faq_answer'>In particular, talking about business information or secrets in any public place including airports, restaurants and bars should be refrained from. Also any information regarding company business must not be disclosed to outsiders regardless of whether it is trivial or confidential. If throwing away documents containing business sensitive information, you must shred the documents. Information can also be disclosed or leaked by carelessness, so it is required to take special care in treating and managing corporate information assets.</p>

                                <div class='faq_answer'>
                                <p>A. What is reasonable and acceptable refers to what is generally deemed acceptable by most people and without there being any sense of largesse. So in practical terms it may refer to a gift or treat about which the provider and recipient feel no psychological or financial burden, but which rather upholds the principle of trust and faith. However, in practical situations, it is not easy to make a clear distinction regarding whether or not the gift or treat you are receiving or offering is socially acceptable or permitted according to conventional norms. The following guidelines are prepared to help you make a proper judgment about this. In general, when all of the following guidelines are satisfied, then the gift or treat can be accepted.</p>
                                <p>1. They generally conform with accepted business practices and are taken as a sign of goodwill</p>
                                <p>2. They are not worth very much in monetary terms and are not frequently offered</p>
                                <p>3. They do not affect the reputation of the organization and its members even when the acceptance or offering of them is public</p>
                                <p>4. They are no quid pro quos involved</p>

He was offered a treat at an adult entertainment spot by the partner company. If he accepts the offer, then is it against the Code of Ethics?</p>
                                <p class='faq_answer'>A. We have to refuse this sort of offer by partners, contractors or third parties, even though it may not be easy to refuse the offer flatly. Especially expensive treats at spots like an adultery entertainment venue can cause a serious problem. If you accepted such an expensive treat, it is understood that no reciprocal favors are expected.</p>

                                <p class='faq_answer'>A. Accepting the package does not seem inappropriate. This is because the package was sent from the heart and not from the wallet, so to speak. In addition, a sisterhood relationship is not a business-oriented relationship. Also, returning the gift would seem surly and might damage an established relationship. The gift can be shared with employees who worked together in projects related to the sisterhood relationship.</p>

                                <p>Q. G is a 30-year-old lady who works for K Research Lab as a researcher. She was sexually harassed at the last team gathering and was overcome with shame and anger afterwards. In an inebriated state, the manager said to her at the gathering: "G you are old and about to have menopausal symptoms. That means you are not a woman any more, but a granny." Then he hugged her and touched her thighs and got angry when she refused. The very next day, G asked the manager to apologize but the manager kept avoiding the matter, saying that he could not remember what happened. He also started to make things unpleasant for G's by not assigning her any tasks, etc. With regard to this story about G, what should be done by the person concerned or 3rd parties to address the situation? 
                                    <br>- Quoted from a case study on sexual harassment education prepared by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family -</p>
                                <p class='faq_answer'>A. Sexual harassment is immoral behavior as well as a serious crime that infringes upon human rights and impedes the proper execution of work while debasing the work atmosphere. The victim of sexual harassment shall request remedial actions and an apology from the perpetrator, and should contact the team leader or Ethical Management Office if the perpetrator refuses to do as requested. Any 3rd parties who witness this sort of situation should also contact the Ethical Management Office or Sexual Harassment Counseling Center.</p>
