            <p>LPG is widely used as fuel for automobiles such as RVs, Hybrid cars, light-weight cars and taxis. Since it emits much less gas compared to NOx, CO and HC, all of which are subject to regulations, and releases no fine dusts (PM10), a known causative factor of respiratory diseases and lung cancer, LPG is the optimal alternative fuel for improving the environment.</p>
            <p>Not only are LPG-fueled vehicles environmentally friendly, they have high energy efficiency and output performance while requiring much less maintenance. They also give off significantly lower noise and vibration, which allows for a comfortable ride. A higher level of safety is achieved through diverse certification of equipment and parts and crash simulations and tests.</p>

            <p>LPG is a clean, pollution-free energy that has high calorific value. Currently 27% of total Korean households are using LPG for cooking and heating. Propane gas in containers are used for cooking and heating and butane gas is also used in butane-gas heaters or canned butane gas products(in 7kg and 13kg containers).</p>
            <p>SK Gas will do its best to improve the service quality and safety management system to ensure the convenience and safety of our customers.</p>

            <p>The bulk tank supply system is a system in which the supplier offers products on a volumetric basis while maintaining the inventory using bulk lorries. This advanced system enables a stable and convenient supply of gas to facilities like apartments with relevant facilities such as tanks in given volumes, pipes and meters.</p>
            <p>Advantages</p>
            <p>No need to place order for gas purchases</p>
            <p>No need to worry about running out of gas</p>
            <p>Pay-as-you-go based on the usage from meter readings</p>
            <p>Protected against the risk of gas leaks, as it is supplied through metal piping</p>

            <p>Industrial LPG is used as a fuel in industries such as ceramics, steel, painting, printing, paper, textile, resin, and food or as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry. LPG has a higher calorific value compared to other fuels, and is widely known as a clean, eco-friendly fuel for industrial use.</p>

            <p>As international oil prices have been high in recent years, this has caused quite an increase in the price of Naptha, a representative petro-chemical material. Therefore it is expected that LPG will have a competitive edge in terms of price compared to Naptha. To cope with the fluctuation in the supply-demand balance and fuel prices, domestic petro-chemical industries have increasingly adopted propane and butane as feedstock to produce propylene, ammonia and phosphoric acid.</p>
            <p>SK Gas is keeping pace with the rapid changes in the market such as diversification of supply sources and cost saving strategies and is increasing LPG demand by supplying LPG at a relatively lower price compared to Naptha.</p>
